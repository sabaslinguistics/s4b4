Human mental inferences from daily events require an understanding of the
cause-and-effect relationship which is generally called “causality”. speaking
about events and the influence of language on the perception of cause and effect
is undeniable. when we read texts such as news headlines, fairy tales, or even
events told by others, we are judging what is what. More precisely, we tend to
choose an explanation for the cause and the causee of events. there are some
linguistic processes which may conceal the cause of an effect by making noun out
of verbs nominalization, (Hull; R. D. & Gomez, 1996; Quirk et al.,1995) or
faster processes of causality if the direction of sentences are iconic with
temporality (Briner et al., 2012) or slower when it is temporal in non-episodic
events (Kaiser, 2019; Moeschler et al., 2006 among others) As there is no single
answer to this question: Is effect-cause or cause-effect episodes processed
easier, and since results vary about this issue the present paper reviews the
results of researches about causality in discourse and the processing of
causality in humans’ mind.
